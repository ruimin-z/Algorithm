## 📝 Description

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## 💡 Solution

### Logic 

- Unordered 
- Duplicates exist
- Cannot use one element twice

1. Why use hash?
2. Why use map?
3. What are the key, value storing?

- Map: key is number, value is index



### Complexity Analysis

#### Time: O(n)
- traverse through list of nums: O(n)
- search in map: O(1)
- insert in map: O(1)

#### Space: O(n)
- new dictionary O(n)

## 🔍 Code

```python
def twoSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list:
    elements = {}
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        if target - n in elements:
            return [elements[target - n], i]
        elements[n] = i
```
